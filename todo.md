## Backend - Autonomous Engine
- [x] server/autonomous.ts - Autonomous analysis engine with LLM integration
- [x] server/scheduler.ts - 8am/6pm CST cron job scheduler

- [x] Meta Ads API integration (campaign data sync with lifetime date preset)
- [x] Risk-based execution logic (low-risk auto-execute, high-risk hold for approval)
- [x] Campaign performance analysis and action generation
